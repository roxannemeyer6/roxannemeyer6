# Python-Challenge
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of PyBank. 
The dataset wass composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records 
to calculate each of the following values:
    (\n)The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
My code then generates a text file with these results. 

I was also tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the votes of a rural town. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script 
that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
    The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote
My code then generates a text file with these results.
