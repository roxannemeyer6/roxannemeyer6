# Python-Challenge
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of PyBank. 
The dataset wass composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records 
to calculate each of the following values:
    The total number of months included in the dataset, 
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,  
    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, 
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and
    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. 
My code then generates a text file with these results. 
Financial Analysis
------------------------
Total Months:86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: -8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

I was also tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the votes of a rural town. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script 
that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
    The total number of votes cast, 
    A complete list of candidates who received votes, 
    The percentage of votes each candidate won, 
    The total number of votes each candidate won, and
    The winner of the election based on popular vote.
In the end I was able to calulate the following:
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369712
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.048% (85213)
Candidate: 0.000% (1)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)

Please note that my vote tallies had 1 for a no name candidate. I believe there was a typo accidentally made in my data.
